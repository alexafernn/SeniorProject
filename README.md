# Code/Art Future LeadHERS Project - App Git 

## Group: Alexandra Fernandez & Isabelle Rivera

## Overview of Project: 
The goal of the Code/Art LEADHers project is to create an iOS application for young female students who are a part of Code/Art’s Future Tech LeadHERS program. Code/Art is a nonprofit organization aimed at getting more girls into the computer science field. Hence, this application, along with the database and administrative dashboard, is aimed to help keep female students engaged in Computer Science in the middle school and high school years. This application includes account creation and login where a student will be able to view events and internships that are being hosted by Code/Art or one of their partners. The administrative dashboard will be accessed only on a desktop or laptop where admins can create, modify, or delete these events and internships. In addition, they can easily remove, modify, or create user or admin accounts. Thus, this project provides security and ease of use to its users and its administrators. 

## List of directories/files:
The entire git repo is needed for the app to work in Xcode. However, the main files for all the views can be found in the ‘Art’ Folder in the repo. Once in that folder, all the views and their respective code can be found in files labeled, “ViewController”, “FirstViewController”, etc. The files that were made directly from Xcode in that directory are info.plist, NetworkingService.swift, AppDelegate.swift, and .DS_Store. Each view controller has a comment at the top of the file to explain the exact view the file holds code for. Some extra requirements and specifications can also be found on the ‘Main.Storyboard’ which will need to be viewed through the Xcode application. 

## Implemented Features: 
1. All views: Login, Forgot Password, Sign up, Side menu navigation, profile, internships/events option view, internships view, detailed internship view, events view, detailed events view. 
2. Communication with database for sign up and login 
3. Alert dialogs for login, logout, forgot password
4. All buttons connecting to specific views 
5. Connection to third party url if you click on get tickets or apply to internship 
6. Code/Art fonts and color scheme used throughout the app 
7. Database communication in the profile, internships, detailed internships, events, detailed events view. 
8. Drop down instead of string input for sign up/profile 

## Future Features: 
1. Bar Code Rewards System
2. Confirmation Email when user creates account
3. Forgot Password Functionality

## Dependencies: 
1. Xcode - Version 12.4 (12D4e) - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
2. Swift 5 - https://swift.org/download/
3. Cocoapods installed on computer - https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html

## Instructions for Compilation
Regarding the application, one must first install Xcode - Version 12.4 on their computer. They must also download Swift 5 and Cocoapods. Then they need to go to the git repository and clone the files onto their computer by using the command “git clone” followed by the HTTP link of the Github repository. Once the files are cloned, they need to open their Xcode application and open the folder they now have on their computer. Once the project is opened on XCode one must choose the “iPhone 11 Pro Max as their Simulator”.

## Instructions for Running
Press the play button on the upper left-hand corner of the Xcode IDE in order to see the app appear on their computer on the simulator.
