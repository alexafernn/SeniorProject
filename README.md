# Code/Art Future LeadHERS Project - App Git 

## Group: Alexandra Fernandez & Isabelle Rivera

## Overview of Project: 
The goal of the Code/Art LEADHers project is to create an iOS application for young female students who are a part of Code/Artâ€™s Future Tech LeadHERS program. Code/Art is a nonprofit organization aimed at getting more girls into the computer science field. Hence, this application, along with the database and administrative dashboard, is aimed to help keep female students engaged in Computer Science in the middle school and high school years. This application includes account creation and login where a student will be able to view events and internships that are being hosted by Code/Art or one of their partners. The administrative dashboard will be accessed only on a desktop or laptop where admins can create, modify, or delete these events and internships. In addition, they can easily remove, modify, or create user or admin accounts. Thus, this project provides security and ease of use to its users and its administrators.
